    <h1>My Working Life</h1>
    <h2>At Midnapore College</h2>
    <p>
        My first work as an instrument preparator started at <a href="https://midnaporecollege.ac.in/midnapore-college-centre-for-scientific-culture-csc/">Science Centre, Midnapore Collge</a> Then after masters, I started working as project
        student at Physics department which resulted in a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UTovaaZbk7Dld_531fVEVh94gDb_Ic3p/view">peer reviwed publication</a>.
